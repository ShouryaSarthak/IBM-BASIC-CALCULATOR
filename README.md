A basic calculator program performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The code usually asks the user to enter two numbers and then choose which operation to perform. Based on the user's choice, the calculator processes the input and displays the correct result.

Most basic calculator codes follow this structure:

Input Section

The program takes two numeric inputs from the user.

It then asks which operation the user wants to perform.

Operation Handling

Using conditional statements (like if-else or switch cases), the program checks the chosen operation.

Each operation is linked to a simple mathematical formula.

Output Section

The calculator displays the final result clearly.

It may also handle invalid inputs (like dividing by zero or choosing the wrong option).

Optional Enhancements

Re-running the calculator in a loop.

Adding more functions like modulus, power, or square root.

This kind of program helps beginners understand variables, input/output, conditions, loops, and basic logic building — the core fundamentals of programming.
